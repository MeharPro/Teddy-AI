# Teddy-AI
We've made a moving AI robot assistant with servos using a RaspberryPi, able to move on command, talk using its voice and mic input, retrieve past conversations, and as it's using OpenAIs GPT-3.5-turbo, it's not limited to any conversation.   This bot uses OpenAI, WeatherAPI, and it's not limited to any other AI implementation.
